# Author's Description
Below this section are some instructions to enable you to run the app as give by the React people. You should just need
to do an npm install and npm start once you've navigated to the project directory and it'll open by itself in your default browser.

Had I got more time. Well I spent a fair bit of time on this and then decided it was getting a bit silly for a Saturday night, I wanted my wine, so I finally put it down.

I would style it better because it's pretty ugly. I'd put better feedback in place for when a user has made their payment. I've been re-teaching myself React along the way which is partly why I'd put more time into it so I'm liking React again, but commercially more experienced in Vue.

I think that's about it really. Cosmetics. Maybe some code tidies. In particular for the form; I think I could have written a single function to handle input, receive the input and pass a field name along the way enabling a single function to handle all of it because it would then be able to modify the state for any of the fields. That kind of thing.

Cheers



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
